<H1>CSV to Database</H1>
<p>For this application, you're able to upload a .xslx file (usually made from an excel sheet) and transform its contents into a csv file, which will subsequently be transformed into a mysql database table. Fill in your MySQL credentials into the 'csv_to_form.php' and then open up the index.php file.</p><br><br>
<p>The boats.xslx was the mockdata I used for this project, delete_boats.php was what I used to immediately erase the table I just made from my database.</p>
